    "First, I visually assess `df_archive` by opening the csv file on Excel (it is easier to have a scroll through the datset than by Pandas. First thing I noticed there are a lot of empty field at the columns `in_reply_to_status_id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `retweeted_status_id`, `retweeted_status_user_id`, `retweeted_status_timestamp`. These fields indicate the tweet is a retweet or not. I probably need to drop rows with non-empty field under these columns for the purpose of this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next for the last four columns (`doggo`, `floofer`, `pupper` and  `puppo`), they all represent various stages of dogs so it should be grouped under a single column (untidy data). Also , most of the fields under these columns are indicated by string \"none\", instead of being empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another data quality issue was found under `name` column. There are names called \"none\" and \"a'. "

    "I import the csv into pandas. First, use .info() to inspect columns dtype and missing values. I found erroneous datatypes for columns `timestamp`, `in_reply_to_status_id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `retweeted_status_id`, `retweeted_status_user_id`, `retweeted_status_timestamp`.\n",
    "I use df_archive.duplicated() to check if any duplicate tweets in the dataset. There is none.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I use .describe() to check any abnormal outliers for numeric values. For `rating_numerator`, the maximum rating is 1776, while a typical rating should only be around 10-20. So I clicked on the [URL](https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/749981277374128128) for that tweet to see if it is a genuine data. It in fact is a valid rating. And there are 24 ratings above 20 `sum(df_archive['rating_numerator'] > 20`. Some of them are the total ratings for a group of dogs in the same picture. I won't do anything about these ratings now but will return to them during EDA."
